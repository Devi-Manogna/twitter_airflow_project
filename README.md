# twitter_airflow_project

Embarking on a data engineering project using the Twitter API and Apache Airflow. The project involves connecting Tweepy to orchestrate the extraction of tweet data through Python tasks within Airflow's DAGs. This initiative aims to streamline workflows, systematically retrieve tweets, and leverage Airflow's scheduling capabilities. Integrating Tweepy within Airflow allows me to explore data engineering principles, covering aspects from API connectivity to exporting results in CSV format.
