# twitter_airflow_project

- Embarking on a data engineering venture, I'm utilizing the Twitter API and Apache Airflow to streamline workflows. Using Tweepy, I orchestrate the extraction of tweet data through Python tasks within Airflow's DAGs. This initiative not only systematically retrieves tweets but also capitalizes on Airflow's scheduling capabilities. The integration of Tweepy within Airflow serves as a practical exploration of data engineering principles, encompassing API connectivity and results export in CSV format.

- Specifically, my focus in this project is on extracting the first 200 tweets of Elon Musk using the Twitter API and Airflow. The overarching goal is to generate a CSV file with the specified tweet format. This project serves as a practical endeavor to comprehend the workings of Airflow, providing valuable insights into its capabilities and the orchestration of data workflows.
